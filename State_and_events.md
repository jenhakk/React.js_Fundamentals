# State and Events

## What is react state?

- Built-in React object which contains data or information about the component.
- State can be modified based on user action or network changes and component re-renders the browser whenever changes happen.
- The state object is initialized in the constructor and it can store multiple properties.
- When wanting to change the state of the object there are two ways of doing that depending on which object is being used:
-   Class component: this.setState()
-   Function component: setState()
